### About

Due to the "Closed World" assumption of DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing), it cannot monitor a connection made by an application to external services (for e.g. databases). Therefore it marks the connection socket as an "external socket" before checkpointing and recreates it as a "dead socket" afterwards, effectively disrupting the connection to the external service.

This plugin safely disconnects an application from a database (MySQL in this case) before checkpointing and automatically reconnects on resume/restart without the application being aware of it.
